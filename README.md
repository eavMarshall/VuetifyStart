# VuetifyStart

Webpack, Vue, Vuetify and Jest starter pack

Avoiding the use of vuecli will allow you to migrate pages away from Vue if you decided to in the future. Don't marry your projects to a library of framework.

Before starting
```sh
$ npm install
```

## Commands
```sh
$ npm run start
$ npm run test-watch
$ npm run build
$ npm run test
```

#### npm run start
Runs a continues develop build

#### npm run test-watch
Runs and re-runs the unit tests, I like to run this at the same time as *npm run start*

#### npm run build
Production build, use this in your build pipeline

#### npm run test
One off run of the jest unit tests, use this in your build pipeline
